# console.log (kənˈsōl)
Soothing consolation while you code

# Usage
Add the console.log script to your code and feel better. You can do it, you are great.


# Disclaimer
This is a bad idea and no one should use this. The code isn't even well written. The whole purpose of this repo is to make fun of a coworker who says console the wrong way, as in: comfort (someone) at a time of grief or disappointment
